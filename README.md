# Magical Arena

In the Magical Arena, players engage in turn-based combat where they roll dice to determine attack and defense outcomes. Damage inflicted by an attacking player, calculated by multiplying their attack value with the attacking dice roll, is mitigated by the defending player's strength multiplied by the defending dice outcome, ultimately reducing the defender's health until one player's health reaches zero, ending the game.
